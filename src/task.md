### Snake case to camel case

Given a snake case string, like `hello_children`, return the camel case string, like `helloChildren`.
Note that the first letter is not capitalized.

Assume: 
- the input will always be a string
- the input will always be snake case
- the input will always be lowercase
- the input will ONLY contain letters and underscores
